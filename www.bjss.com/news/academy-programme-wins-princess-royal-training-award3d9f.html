          <span><p><a href="../indexc6eb.html?hsLang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BJSS </a>today announces that its <a href="../academy/indexc6eb.html?hsLang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BJSS Academy</a> learning and development programme has been recognised by the <a href="https://www.princessroyaltrainingawards.com/2021-recipients/" rel="noopener">2021 Princess Royal Training Awards</a>.</p>
<p>Currently in its sixth year, The Princess Royal Training Awards recognise and celebrate organisations across the United Kingdom which have demonstrated exceptional commitment to training and development.</p>
<span>The award programme recognises the BJSS Academy’s emphasis on creating equal opportunities for people from all backgrounds. This infrastructure, which supports school leavers, apprentices, university graduates, and people retraining or returning to work, comprises several physical, digital and virtual learning channels. Unlike many other programmes, the BJSS Academy immerses students into real-life client projects, allowing them to learn from more experienced members of staff and develop an understanding of how to deliver complex technology solutions to international clients.</span>
<p><br>Additionally, the BJSS Academy is playing its part in addressing the skills challenge and improving gender diversity within the technology sector. 34% of the most recent intake of students identified as women, against an industry average of less than 20% of total workforce.<br><br><span>Frazer Robinson, Head of Talent at BJSS</span>, says: “The BJSS Academy has driven an increase in the diversity of our teams, and supported our local communities by providing new opportunities. It’s also rewarding for those developing and delivering the programme, providing professional development, and underpinning our vision for BJSS as a great place to work.”<br><br><span>Stuart Bullock, Managing Director at BJSS</span>, continues: “As well as helping to address the challenges of the tech industry skills shortage, the BJSS Academy has delivered many other benefits aligned to our strategic vision including; supporting continued sustainable growth and growing our workforce by identifying and nurturing talent from different backgrounds.<br><br>I am thrilled that the BJSS Academy has been recognised by the Princess Royal Training Awards as an outstanding training and skills development programme which has resulted in exceptional commercial benefits for BJSS.”<br><br><span>Kirstie Donnelly MBE, Chief Executive of the City &amp; Guilds Group,</span> says: “The last 18 months have caused disruption to the way most organisations operate which has led to major changes for all of us in how we live and work. Despite these challenges, it’s fantastic to see so many organisations’ continued commitment to training and development as well as the positive and life changing impact learning can have on people.”<br><br>This award win follows on from <a href="academy-programme-takes-next-step-forwardc6eb.html?hsLang=en" rel="noopener">BJSS’ recent commitment to recruit over 200 people</a> in the BJSS Academy’s 2021/2022 intake across all disciplines. Applications to join the BJSS Academy are now open. It runs across all of BJSS’ UK offices.
