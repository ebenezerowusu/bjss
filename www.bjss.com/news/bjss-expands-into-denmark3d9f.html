        <div class="blog-section">
          <span><p>BJSS, the leading British technology and engineering consultancy, today announced its expansion into Denmark, with Copenhagen being the company’s 26th location and its first in Scandinavia. The initial investment in Denmark is DKK 35 million (£4 million) within 3 years, with plans to recruit over 75 employees into the Copenhagen office by 2025.</p>
<p>The BJSS Denmark office is situated in Copenhagen’s former meat packing district which has been modernised with new offices and restaurants, and attracts the city’s entrepreneurs and creative minds.</p>
<p>The initial focus will be to recruit IT professionals to support BJSS’ technology, engineering, consulting, cloud, data and AI services. Initially, the Copenhagen office will supplement the support of local clients with BJSS´ UK portfolio while focusing on gradually expanding operations in the region.</p>
<p><span>Steen Hommel, State Secretary of Commerce and Sustainability</span>, said: “BJSS has knowledge and experience of carrying out enterprise IT projects, which is very attractive to Denmark. Our opinion is that increasing competition in this area will improve the quality of future IT projects - including the efficiency of execution.</p>
<p>Invest In Denmark has worked closely with BJSS to help it establish itself in Denmark. This is because we see the development of IT solutions as a growth area that both ensures effective solutions for public and private companies and creates attractive jobs. Therefore, there is a focus on strengthening the education within the area and attracting knowledge that can support that development.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Copenhagen office is led by Rasmus Koefoed-Jespersen, who has been Head of <a href="../design/indexc6eb.html?hsLang=en" rel="noopener">SPARCK</a>, the strategic design and innovation arm of BJSS, since 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Amir Soufizadeh, Head of International Expansion, BJSS</span>, commented: “Denmark presents interesting opportunities for BJSS as it is one of the most digitised societies in the world with brilliant and diverse talent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BJSS’ extensive service offerings will help Danish companies to enhance their digital capabilities further and secure rapid and continuous gains that drive their transformation forward. BJSS’ experience in the UK and other countries across the globe gives us insights that are unique and valuable in a Danish context.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Stuart Bullock, Managing Director, BJSS</span>, said: “International growth continues to be a key strategy for BJSS and our expansion into Scandinavia is a step to further strengthening our European presence.</p>
<p>In 2020, we opened our first European office in Portugal. Choosing Denmark as our next area of focus in Europe is logical, as it will strengthen our ties to our current and potential Scandinavian clients.”</p></span>
