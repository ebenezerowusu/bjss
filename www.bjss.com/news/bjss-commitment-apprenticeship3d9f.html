          <span><p><strong>Today the UK Department for Education implemented an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-levy/apprenticeship-levy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apprenticeship Levy</a>&nbsp;which aims to&nbsp;combine employment with&nbsp;skills and quality training. BJSS, the award-winning, delivery-focused IT consultancy is already an enthusiastic employer of apprentices, and we look forward to welcoming even more apprentices to our&nbsp;team.</strong></p>
<p>Our apprentices contribute to a live project and become&nbsp;increasingly ‘hands-on’ as they develop their skills. They also benefit from access to our award-winning internal training channel, the BJSS Academy, and certification related to their chosen career route.</p>
<p><strong>Harrison Chapman (Testing Apprentice, 2016)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>"One of the most amazing things about BJSS is the fountain of knowledge you can tap into. When I kicked off my apprenticeship at BJSS, I got the opportunity to interact with people across the different testing roles and learn about what their day-to-day jobs involve. The experience has taught me a lot about the different tools and techniques you can use to test software.</p>
<p>Even though I was a new apprentice, I was quickly assigned to the team responsible for testing the new MOT system for the DVSA. This was a challenging project, but my colleagues supported me throughout, and my confidence quickly kicked in. Since then I’ve worked on testing assignments for separate projects for two additional clients. I am also part of the BJSS delivery team providing pro-bono consultancy support to <strong><a href="http://www.turinglab.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turinglab</a></strong>, a <strong><a href="../community/indexc6eb.html?hsLang=en">BJSS CSR</a></strong> partner that provides fundamental IT teaching support to disadvantaged children. In this role, I am responsible for conducting non-functional testing using JMeter, so that Turinglab can expand its service to British schools and handle lots of concurrent users.</p>
<p>Today I am a permanent member of the BJSS testing team. I get to work on exciting projects, I meet lots of really clever people, and I get to use some really cool software tools. It has been rewarding for me to kick off my career as an apprentice, and the scheme has provided me with a worthwhile and valuable route into IT Consulting."</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Woodhead&nbsp;(Testing Apprentice, 2016)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>"After completing sixth form, I joined BJSS as an apprentice and was exposed to project work almost immediately. I was lucky enough to spend a year on the NHS e-RS project in a team of approximately seven functional testers. Here I contributed to supporting the application after the NHS had made it live.</p>
<p>I was tasked with adhering to NHS Digital’s strict deadlines and BJSS’ uncompromising commitment to quality. I thoroughly enjoyed this engagement because I knew I was making a positive impact towards healthcare. I’ve now successfully completed my apprenticeship and I’m delighted to have been offered a permanent job at BJSS to stay on as a Junior Functional Tester.</p>
<p>BJSS offers continued support and I feel very lucky to have started my career at a company that values its employees and places importance in creativity, collaboration and passion."</p>
<p><strong>Glynn Robinson, BJSS Managing Director, says:</strong> "We place a particular emphasis on youth development. Our Apprenticeship Programme offers compelling career routes into IT consultancy for talented school and college leavers."</p></span>
