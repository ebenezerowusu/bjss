          <span><p><strong>BJSS, in partnership with the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), has won the Public Sector Project of the Year category of the Techworld Awards for the re-engineering of the NHS Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data platform.</strong></p>
<p>HES was conceived in the late 1980s and provides data for a wide range of healthcare analysis for the NHS, government and supporting organisations. The enables access to secure analysis of health trends, performance benchmarks, academic research and international comparisons.</p>
<p>The project was delivered by BJSS and the HSCIC and resulted in the entire system being re-written. The 3.5 million lines of SQL code contained in HES were reduced by 97 per cent, while a 500-step manual process is now fully automated. This ‘next-generation’ version of HES is now operated and maintained by the HSCIC in-house, enabling work to be handled with increased efficiency while also delivering a significant reduction in operating costs.</p>
<p><strong>Glynn Robinson, BJSS Managing Director</strong>, says: “Over the past twenty years, BJSS has delivered complex software solutions to many clients across the private sector. Our move into the public sector has been more recent, and we’re truly honoured that HES, which was our first ‘high profile’ delivery in the public sector and created in true partnership with the HSCIC, has been recognised by the industry in the form of this important award”.</p>
<p>Commenting on BJSS' success <strong>Mike Simons, Editor of Computerworld UK</strong>, said: "Many congratulations to BJSS who were worthy winners of the Public Sector Project of the Year in the Techworld Awards 2013. These awards were the most competitive yet and all the winners demonstrated significant innovation in their products and the ability to deliver strong ROI to their customers".</p>
<p>In addition to re-engineering HES, BJSS is currently working with the HSCIC in developing the new NHS e-Referral Service<a title="NHS engages BJSS to build NHS e-Referral Service" href="nhs-engages-bjss-build-nhs-e-referral-service/indexc6eb.html?hsLang=en"></a>, while also delivering the NHS Spine 2 messaging and secure database platform.</p></span>
