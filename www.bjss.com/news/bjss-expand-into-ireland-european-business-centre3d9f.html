          <span><p>Aligned with its ambitious international growth strategy, BJSS, the leading technology consultancy for business, has today announced plans to establish a new delivery centre in Dublin, which will lead to the creation of 75 new roles.</p>

<p>Founded in 1993, BJSS offers clients support from service design at the early stages right through to outsourced project delivery and managed services. In addition, the company provides strategic consulting advice in multiple areas, including AI, machine learning, cloud, and cyber security. As of September 2022, BJSS employed more than 2,500 employees in 26 offices throughout the UK, US, Australia, Portugal and Denmark.</p>
<p>BJSS is a long-term strategic partner to the leading cloud vendors, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. With the cloud vendors already well established in Dublin, BJSS is looking forward to strengthening its partnership with these companies even further.</p>
<p><strong>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar</strong> said: “I’m really pleased that BJSS has chosen Ireland for its European business and delivery centre. The company’s new base in Dublin will create 75 jobs.&nbsp;This is another vote of confidence in Ireland’s ability to attract the world’s leading companies. BJSS is a global leader in IT and Business Consultancy, offering expert advice in areas from AI to cyber security. It’s also testament to the talent and skills of our highly-trained and educated workforce. I wish BJSS every success on this exciting new chapter in Ireland.”</p>
<p><strong>Amir Soufizadeh, Head of International Expansion at BJSS,</strong> said: “Dublin is a hotbed of tech talent and one of Europe's leading innovation hubs, so it makes complete sense for us to open an office there. Not to mention that many of our key partners have a big presence in Dublin, so we'll be able to work even more closely with them, particularly to develop our Irish cloud and data Centre of Excellence capabilities. We're incredibly excited to establish ourselves in such a vibrant city and help local businesses to realise their digital ambitions."</p>
<p><strong>Mary Buckley, Executive Director, IDA Ireland</strong> said: “Ireland’s thriving multinational sector, as well as market demand internationally for digital and business transformation consultancy services, the availability of technology talent, and ability to recruit skilled consultants from the EU talent pool, makes Ireland a very attractive location for international professional services companies. On behalf of IDA Ireland, I’d like to welcome BJSS to Ireland, and I wish them every success with the establishment of its new office.”</p></span>
