          <span><p>BJSS reaffirms its commitment to the US market, with New York and Houston offices to further invest in regional tech talent. With digital transformation continuing to accelerate post-pandemic, businesses require an agile technology solutions provider more than ever before.</p>
<p><span>BJSS has announced plans to open a third office in the US, creating employment opportunities for 300 local skilled technology professionals across the country. </span><br><br><span>BJSS is committed to servicing the US market by increasing its local footprint. After 29 years of assisting US clients with its expertise, predominantly based in the UK, BJSS has become a consultancy of choice for many companies looking outside of traditional system integrators in the United States. This growing physical presence allows BJSS to acquire, retain and upskill US-based tech talent in local communities such as Houston and New York. </span><br><br><span>Focused on rapid growth in the US, BJSS is building on expansion realized over the past two years, with the Houston office currently employing over 50 talented individuals. Opening additional offices in the US has allowed BJSS to invest in local initiatives such as the New York <a href="https://www.thecitytutors.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">City Tutors</a>, providing mentoring and tutoring in technology to disadvantaged youth. As well as this, BJSS has joined the <a href="https://www.houston.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Greater Houston Partnership</a> to work alongside other business leaders in the area to positively impact the local community by strengthening the pipeline of skilled workers in the region. </span><br><br>Sarah Durbridge, Executive Director at <a href="https://www.babinc.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">British American Business Council</a>, Texas<span>, says: “It is fantastic to see BJSS solidifying its presence in the US market. By expanding their physical presence further, BJSS is investing in North American industry and talent, bringing skilled technology opportunities to various regions of the US.”</span><br><br><span><span>Louisa Marlin, Houston Head of Delivery at BJSS</span>, says: <span>“</span></span><span>By creating a stronger foothold in the US, we are able to service our customers with even closer care. Our local teams in Houston and New York provide customers with technical experts on the ground, ready to assist where needed. As we continue on a path of accelerated growth, talented regional individuals will help us provide an all-inclusive service to our clients, with around-the-clock support."</span><br><br><span><span>“</span>At BJSS, we believe that investing in the local skilled workforce is the key to tackling the digital skills shortage. With the digital skills gap continuing to increase across the nation, access to the technology industry mustn't be limited by geographical location. Through programs such as the <a href="../careers/academy.html?hsLang=en" rel="noopener">BJSS Academy</a>, we offer a wide range of learning and development opportunities for employees at all stages of their career, breaking down barriers to technical knowledge." </span><br><br><span><span>Amir Soufizadeh, Head of International Expansion at BJSS</span>, says: </span><span><span>“</span>North America is a critical region for us based on its market size and our existing client portfolio. We are committed to investing further into our US expansion in the coming years. Our expansion plan demonstrates our commitment to addressing our client needs and represents a significant step forward in our regional growth strategy in North America."</span></p></span>
