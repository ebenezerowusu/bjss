          <span><p><strong>Since opening its Scottish hub last summer, BJSS, the UK’s largest privately-owned IT consultancy and recent winner of the Queen’s Award for Enterprise, has doubled its workforce of Glasgow-based IT professionals.</strong></p>
<p>This 40-member team is led by <strong>Laura Casci, the company’s new Head of Delivery for Scotland</strong>. Having joined BJSS from Certeco, Laura is responsible for ensuring the delivery of existing projects. In addition, Laura will be responsible for increasing the company’s Scottish footprint by implementing focused business development capabilities.</p>
<p>BJSS, which is currently delivering a large-scale IT transformation to Disclosure Scotland, has a strong track record in delivering to clients in the Financial Services, Retail, Commodities, Healthcare and Public Services industries. Having signed up to the Scottish Business Pledge, and in order to service the needs of local clients, BJSS commits to adding at least 20 new permanent roles in 2018.</p>
<p>BJSS also commits to developing skills within Scotland’s ICT sector. Through a partnership with Code Clan, an organisation dedicated to further improving the digital skills of professionals across the region, BJSS will help to identify and train key talent for permanent roles in the organisation. Additionally, BJSS is pleased to announce that its community investment partnership with Turinglab, an organisation dedicated to teaching fundamental coding skills to British schoolchildren, will be extended to Glasgow. As part of this initiative, BJSS will fund the delivery of free coding lessons to children from less advantaged family backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>Laura Casci,&nbsp;Head of Delivery</strong>, said: “We are very excited about the growth we are seeing in Scotland, and Glasgow in particular. This has been made possible by having access to a highly skilled pool of talent who have come from some of the best universities in Europe. We are not only committed to helping Scottish companies resolve their most complex IT and business issues but also ensuring that we continue to develop the talent to do so.”</p></span>
