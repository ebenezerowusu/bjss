        <div class="blog-section">
          <span><p><a href="../indexc6eb.html?hsLang=en"><strong>BJSS</strong></a><strong> today announced that it has successfully become an AWS Migration Competency partner, validating its experience and knowledge of migrating complex workloads to AWS. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The AWS Competency Programme recognises AWS Partners who demonstrate and maintain technical proficiency and proven customer success in specialised solution areas, including cloud migrations.</p>
<p>This comes at a time when organisations across the public and private sectors are looking to accelerate their cloud migration programmes to become more efficient and agile in the digital age. AWS APN Partners like BJSS have deep AWS expertise and are uniquely positioned to help companies at any stage of their cloud adoption journey to take full advantage of all that AWS has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Mohamed Zamzam, Cloud Migrations and Services Lead </strong>at BJSS, says: “Since its beginning, BJSS has built up its expertise and knowledge from transforming and modernising large-scale enterprise applications. We were early adopters of AWS and have helped public sector clients such as <a href="../e-rs-cloud-migration/indexc6eb.html?hsLang=en"><strong>NHS Digital</strong></a> and the <a href="../driving-the-dvsa-to-the-cloud/indexc6eb.html?hsLang=en"><strong>DVSA</strong></a> to migrate, modernise and digitise the services they offer to citizens. We’ve also helped private sector clients such as <a href="../goal-group-creating-a-future-proof-business/indexc6eb.html?hsLang=en#:~:text=Goal%20Group%20is%20a%20FinTech,securities%20class%20action%20recovery%20services.&amp;text=Goal's%20focus%20on%20innovation%2C%20combined,its%20migration%20to%20the%20cloud."><strong>Goal Group</strong></a> to go ‘all in’ on AWS, closing down their data centre just as the pandemic was taking hold and affecting market conditions. By migrating to the cloud, Goal Group was able to transition to a remote working model during the lockdowns, which wouldn’t have been possible on its legacy data centre.”</p>
<p><strong>Zamzam continues: “</strong>We’re delighted to be recognised and awarded the AWS Migration Competency. It validates our experience and proven customer successes in migrating workloads to AWS as well as our alignment to the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework. Furthermore, this illustrates the continued importance that BJSS places on being an AWS Partner, and how it can help our clients transform their organisations.”</p>
<p><strong>Commenting on Goal Group’s recent migration to AWS, Stephen Everard, CEO </strong>at Goal Group, adds: “This migration was an integral and essential step in the evolution of our technology to support our growth strategy, including developing new products to facilitate entry into new markets. It simply would not have been possible to execute this strategy without our partners at BJSS.”</p>
<p>As part of BJSS’ AWS Migration Competency, organisations can now benefit from BJSS Enterprise Cloud – a proven landing zone accelerator that has helped the Department of Health &amp; Social Care and the Scottish Government to accelerate their journeys to AWS.</p>
