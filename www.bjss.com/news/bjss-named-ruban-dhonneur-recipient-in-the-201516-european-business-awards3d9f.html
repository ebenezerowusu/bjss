          <span><p><strong>BJSS, the delivery-focused IT consultancy, has been named as a Ruban d’Honneur recipient in the 2015/16 European Business Awards sponsored by RSM.</strong></p>
<p>After initially competing with over 32,000 companies from across Europe, BJSS was chosen from a shortlist of 678 UK National Champions by a panel of judges made up of European business and political leaders, academics and entrepreneurs. The company is one of 110 Ruban d’Honneur recipients chosen from across Europe, and only one of nine from the UK.</p>
<p>“Being selected as a Ruban d’Honneur winner from over 30,000 contestants across Europe is a great honour,” says <strong>Frazer Robinson, Head of Marketing for BJSS</strong>. “The European Business Awards is widely recognised as the showcase for Europe’s most dynamic companies and we are very pleased that the judging panel has recognised our achievements over the past two decades.”</p>
<p>The European Business Awards, now in its ninth year, is Europe’s largest and most significant cross-sector business recognition programme. Over 32,000 businesses from 33 European countries were engaged during the 2015 competition. In the 2014/15 competition, all EU member markets were represented plus Turkey, Norway, Switzerland, Serbia, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Their combined revenue exceeded €1.5 trillion, generating profits of over 60 billion Euros and employing over 2.5 million people.</p>
<p><strong>Adrian Tripp, CEO of the European Business Awards</strong>, says: “To survive in this economic climate is hard enough, so to innovate, prosper and grow in the way this year’s Ruban D’Honneur recipients have is truly remarkable. Europe needs more companies like these. Well done to BJSS.”</p>
<p><strong>Jean Stephens, CEO of RSM</strong>, says: “At RSM, we help middle-market companies to operate in the increasingly complex and rapidly changing global business landscape. The Ruban d’Honneurs announced today are typical of those companies that our member firms work with on a daily basis, and so it is encouraging to see their growth and prosperity. We wish them well in the third and final round of judging and look forward to announcing the overall category winners at the Gala Event.”</p>
<p>The European Business Awards was created to celebrate and promote business success and support the development of a stronger and more successful business community throughout Europe.</p></span>
