          <span><p><strong>BJSS recognised as Global Healthcare Partner of the Year, one of many AWS Partners around the globe that help customers drive innovation.</strong></p>

<p>International technology consultancy BJSS is excited to announce it is the recipient of a 2022 Global AWS Partner Award, which recognises leaders around the globe playing a key role helping customers drive innovation and build solutions on Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS).</p>
<p>Announced during a Partner Awards Gala at AWS re:Invent 2022, the Regional and Global AWS Partner Awards recognise a wide range of AWS Partners, whose business models have embraced specialisation, innovation, and cooperation over the past year. Regional and Global AWS Partner Awards recognise partners whose business models continue to evolve and thrive on AWS as they work with customers.</p>
<p>The award is a testament to a decade of BJSS’ work with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), as well as other healthcare providers, to deliver a range of critical digital services using AWS products and services that healthcare professionals and the public rely on every day, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developing a population-wide risk stratification therapeutic solution</strong> and online population assessment viewer to identify and prioritise individuals most at risk from Covid-19, which resulted in <a href="../our-work/department-of-health-and-social-care-protecting-the-vulnerablec6eb.html?hsLang=en" rel="noopener">1.7 million previously unidentified individuals being added to the shielding list</a> and prioritised for the Covid-19 vaccination rollout program.</li>
<li><strong>Building a cloud environment for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/success/ukhsa-bjss/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UK Health Security Agency’s Test and Trace services</a></strong> to improve and enhance security, resiliency and operational control.</li>
<li><strong>Developing a deep learning model for Care Fertility <a href="https://futurescot.com/unlocking-the-power-of-ai-to-make-babies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to automatically annotate embryo images</a></strong> to better the accuracy for IVF selection and improve chances of success.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike Buck, Director at BJSS</strong>, said, “We’re thrilled to be recognised by AWS for our capabilities in the Healthcare space. It’s a real reflection of our extensive experience building solutions on AWS and how we’ve used innovative technology to deliver greater efficiencies and capabilities for healthcare providers and better outcomes for patients. This award just cements our ambitions to expand our Healthcare services and bring our experience in the UK to other markets in Europe, the United States, and Australia.”</p>
<p>For the first time, Regional and Global AWS Partner Awards include a self-nomination process across a number of award categories and specialisation areas awarded at both the regional and global level where all AWS Partners were invited to participate and submit a nomination.</p>
<p>The AWS Partner Network (APN), is a global program, focused on helping companies build successful AWS-based businesses or solutions by providing business, technical, marketing, and go-to-market support. The APN includes independent software vendors (ISVs) and systems integrators (SIs) around the world, with partner participation growing significantly during the past 12 months.</p>
<p>“AWS Partners are at the centre of unlocking value for global customers, across a wide range of industries,” said Ruba Borno, vice president, Worldwide Channels and Alliances at AWS. “We are honored to launch the inaugural Regional and Global AWS Partner Awards, and thank all the nominees and winners for accelerating customers’ cloud transformation journey.”</p>
<p>A panel of AWS experts selected the winners based on strict criteria. BJSS is excited to announce it has received global Healthcare Partner of the Year, recognising the top partner with the Healthcare or Life Sciences Competency who has delivered innovative mission-based wins for Healthcare customers.</p></span>
