          <span><p>After announcing its arrival to Portugal in 2020, the consultancy expands to Porto with the aim of hiring more than 40 new IT consultants.</p>

<p>Aligned with its ambitious expansion plans, BJSS, the British technology and engineering consultancy, today announced the opening of a new office in Avenida da Boavista, Porto, to provide further assistance to the local team.</p>
<p>Now based in Lisbon and Porto, BJSS has a team of 102 people across both offices and intends to recruit more than 40 IT consultants to join the already established Porto team of 35. BJSS will be hiring a broad range of specialists, including support platform engineers, business analysts and project managers.</p>
<p>"This new investment translates into an office with more than 430 square metres, located in one of Porto's major districts. It's another important step in accomplishing our initial milestone of having a local team of 150 people. We are very proud of this announcement", concludes <strong>Pedro Ferreira, Head of Delivery (Portugal) at BJSS</strong>.</p>
<p>The opening of the new office in Porto follows the global expansion of BJSS into new locations such as Dublin, Melbourne and, more recently, Denmark - with a new office in <a href="bjss-expands-into-denmarkc6eb.html?hsLang=en" rel="noopener">Copenhagen</a>. These add up to a total of 26 offices where the British consultancy is now present across the UK, Europe, USA, and Australia.</p>
<p><span>Amir Soufizadeh, Head of International Expansion at BJSS</span>, adds: "We've had phenomenal growth in our Lisbon office since we opened there less than two years ago. With such great and diverse talent in the country, I am very excited to welcome our local employees to the BJSS Porto office, our second base in Portugal. We continue to expect rapid growth in Portugal as part of our wider international expansion strategy."</p>
<p>Founded in the UK, BJSS received recognition from the UK Embassy for the success of the company's projects in Portugal's IT sector. The British company also holds the <a href="academy-programme-wins-princess-royal-training-awardc6eb.html?hsLang=en" rel="noopener">Princess Royal Training Award</a> 2021, which recognizes a company's commitment to investing in its employees led by BJSS Academy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, BJSS also achieved a prestigious position in the Financial Times' (FT) UK Leading Management Consultants, a list which distinguishes consultancies that have reached the greatest number of recommendations from clients and peers, winning a total of three bronze awards.</p></span>
