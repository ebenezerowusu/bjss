          <span><p><strong>BJSS, the Queen’s Award for Enterprise-winning IT and business consultancy announces a significant fresh investment in its successful Manchester operation.</strong></p>

<p>Expected to exceed £3.5 million in the next financial year alone, the investment includes:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>New prime office space at Union, Albert Square which has been heavily refurbished to promote collaboration and innovative thinking.</li>
<li>A substantial recruitment campaign to hire 50 new professionals, from the Manchester metropolitan area and neighbouring counties.</li>
<li>Headline sponsorship of Manchester Digital’s flagship “Digital Her” community programme.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>“As the birthplace of the industrial revolution, Manchester is now leading the drive in the digital revolution, and BJSS is proud to be part of it. Today’s announcement marks a major milestone for BJSS in Manchester and is a tangible demonstration of our commitment to the city and its digital potential,” says <strong>Matt Whalley, BJSS Head of Delivery</strong>.</p>
<p>BJSS project delivery teams provide digital design, business and IT engineering services to clients in the UK, Europe and the USA. Recent projects delivered by the BJSS Manchester team include award-winning engagements with the Co-operative Group and several digital transformation programmes for ITV.</p>
<p>This investment will enable BJSS to tap further into the pool of skilled local talent. “It means further growth for BJSS and an inspiring working environment that is central to Manchester’s restaurants, bars, shops and museums,” <strong>continues Whalley</strong>. “I encourage bold thinkers who are seeking fresh professional opportunities and want to contribute towards large digital transformations to take a look at us.”</p>
<p><strong>Main strategic partner for all Manchester Digital “Digital Her” activity in 2020</strong></p>
<p>The BJSS investment also includes headline support and sponsorship of the ‘Digital Her’ programme. The initiative works closely with schools across Manchester’s 10 boroughs and aims to tackle the shortage of women employed in the city’s digital and technology industry by demonstrating the breadth of roles and opportunities offered by the digital industry.</p>
<p>“We want a balanced tech sector in Manchester that is filled with opportunities,” explains <strong>Stuart Bullock, BJSS Managing Director</strong>. “We are doing our part by inspiring young people and we are taking positive action to improve diversity in our industry. I’m delighted that our increased investment in our Manchester operation has extended to Digital Her because it improves the long-term prospects for women in IT by boosting confidence, employability and digital skills."</p>
<p>BJSS has supported Digital Her since its inception in 2018, inspiring over 1,200 young women to consider a future within digital and technology. In addition to BJSS’ financial support, key female role models from BJSS will continue to provide mentorship, give advice and hold interactive workshops.</p>
<p>“Manchester Digital is delighted to have BJSS’ continued support in delivering Digital Her – a programme that is tackling the digital gender gap head-on,” says <strong>Emma Grant, talent and skills manager at Manchester Digital</strong>.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with BJSS has already provided support, opportunities and guidance to thousands of young women interested in tech across each of Greater Manchester’s ten boroughs, and our ambitions for 2020 will be even bigger now that the organisation has become our strategic partner for the year.</p>
<p>“To meet our goals, we rely on forward-thinking and socially responsible businesses such as BJSS to continue our work in inspiring and empowering the next generation of women to ensure they believe and feel they have a place in our dynamic and exciting industry.”</p></span>
