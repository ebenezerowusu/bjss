          <span><p><strong>BJSS, the delivery-focused IT consultancy, has been named as a National Champion for the United Kingdom in The European Business Awards sponsored by RSM International; a prestigious competition supported by businesses leaders, academics, media&nbsp;and political representatives from across Europe.</strong></p>
<p>The European Business Awards now in its eighth year engaged with over 24,000 businesses from 33 European countries this year. With 709 National Champions selected throughout Europe, BJSS joins 64 other National Champions representing the United Kingdom in the second phase of the competition.</p>
<p>Established in 1993 in Leeds, BJSS is an award-winning IT consultancy with a growing international presence. The company is recognised for its experience in financial services, commodity trading, media &amp; telecoms, retail, and government sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Glynn Robinson, BJSS Managing Director</strong>, says: "We're very proud to be selected to represent the United Kingdom as a National Champion. The European Business Awards is widely recognised as the showcase for Europe's most dynamic companies and we are looking forward to the next round of the judging process."</p>
<p><strong>Adrian Tripp, CEO of the European Business Awards</strong>, adds: "Congratulations to BJSS. It is a great achievement to be named National Champion and we wish them luck in the next stage. The European Business Awards is going from strength to strength, inspiring businesses to greater success and helping to improve the competitive edge of companies across Europe."</p>
<p><strong>Jean Stephens, CEO of RSM International</strong>, said: "Every year this competition gets tougher and more competitive as more companies, of varied sizes and across all sectors, chose to compete in this prestigious competition. With the increased number of entries and countries, this year looks to become the toughest Awards yet. It will be exciting to watch as we move through to the next round."</p>
<p>A panel of judges made up of Europe-wide business leaders, academics and entrepreneurs will view the National Champions' videos, and award the best of this group the coveted 'Ruban d'Honneur' status. Ruban d'Honneur recipients will then go on to the grand final in 2015. All of the National Champions will also take part in a public vote to decide 'Public Champions' for each country. Last year over 93,000 votes were cast, and over 400,000 people visited the EBA website during the competition.</p>
<p>Supported since their inception by lead sponsor and promoter RSM International, the seventh-largest audit, tax and advisory network worldwide with a major presence across Europe, the European Business Awards was set up to recognise and reward excellence, best practice and innovation across the European business community.</p></span>
