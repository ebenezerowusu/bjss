&lt;p style="margin-top: 25px;"&gt;Organisations today are arguably battling with more hardship than they have had to in recent history. Most are still navigating inflationary pressures, managing the cost-of-living crisis and limiting the negative impact on their business such as loss of revenue and redundancies. While others are still coping with recovery from a global pandemic, all whilst planning for a looming recession. If the last few years have taught business leaders anything, it’s that there’s no time to waste when it comes to making your business more resilient to unexpected change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Four Energy Industry Trends for 2023</title>

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="margin-top: 25px;"&gt;Looking back, I think it’s fair to say that 2022 was a particularly challenging year for the UK’s energy industry. It felt very much felt like a year of plate spinning for all organisations, with a multitude of high-priority projects and focus areas. From the introduction of &lt;a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/energy-policy-and-regulation/policy-and-regulatory-programmes/switching-programme" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ofgem’s Faster Switching programme&lt;/a&gt;, to the continued focus on customer migration (after 28 energy suppliers went bust in 2021, in many cases taken over by larger suppliers), and the pressure of the energy crisis, I’m not sure that 2022 will be a year that is fondly remembered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 25px;"&gt;Aggressive interest rate hikes to tame soaring inflation shook the financial services industry in 2022. The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/business/stocks-bonds-third-quarter.html#:~:text=S%26P%20500,-Dec.&amp;amp;text=Stocks%20slid%20on%20Friday%2C%20closing,more%20than%20a%20decade%20ago."&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 fell for three consecutive quarters in Q3&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 2009. Sky-high tech firm valuations were brought back down to earth, with Google and Meta’s share prices nosediving 60%. And fintech funding dried up after a record-breaking year in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Over the course of 2022, we continued the march into our digital future, asking questions about the role of the physical store along the way: &lt;a href="https://business.yougov.com/content/44687-retail-fmcg-roundup-2022"&gt;53% of Brits stated we’re back to pre-pandemic levels of enjoyment&lt;/a&gt; for in-store shopping, whilst a quarter now believe there’s no reason to go back to in-store shopping at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is 2022 The Year Black Friday Turned Green?</title>
      <link>https://www.bjss.com/industry-insights/2022-the-year-black-friday-turned-green</link>

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="margin-top: 25px;"&gt;Even in spite of rampant inflation and a cost of living crisis, the rumours of Black Friday’s death appear to have been greatly exaggerated. In fact, in many ways the holiday continues to be a success. The stats show us that &lt;a href="https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2022/11/black-friday-sales/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;UK footfall rose 9%&lt;/a&gt; on last year, with Nationwide reporting that the number of &lt;a href="https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2022/11/black-friday-sales/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;purchases rose by roughly 10%.&lt;/a&gt; As you’d expect, electronics and accessories were the most successful category and saw a 19% increase globally. Clearly, many of us Brits decided to brace the cold and trudge back to the high street to hunt for deals in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="margin-top: 25px;"&gt;Even in spite of rampant inflation and a cost of living crisis, the rumours of Black Friday’s death appear to have been greatly exaggerated. In fact, in many ways the holiday continues to be a success. The stats show us that &lt;a href="https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2022/11/black-friday-sales/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;UK footfall rose 9%&lt;/a&gt; on last year, with Nationwide reporting that the number of &lt;a href="https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2022/11/black-friday-sales/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;purchases rose by roughly 10%.&lt;/a&gt; As you’d expect, electronics and accessories were the most successful category and saw a 19% increase globally. Clearly, many of us Brits decided to brace the cold and trudge back to the high street to hunt for deals in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The UK Energy Crisis: How did we get here and what do we need to do next?</title>

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="margin-top: 25px;"&gt;As 2022 draws to a close, many households across the UK are bracing for a challenging winter.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis will impact all families to some extent, but some face graver predicaments than others. Indeed, such is the scale of the expected price rises that up to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/17/two-thirds-of-uk-families-could-be-in-fuel-poverty-by-january-research-finds" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;two-thirds of all UK households&lt;/a&gt; – encompassing some 45 million people - could have slipped into fuel poverty by January 2023. It is a crisis in every sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shoppers hold back spend in October in anticipation of deep Black Friday discounts</title>

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 25px;"&gt;It’s been 10 months since I’ve had an upbeat ONS retail update to share, but today I’m starting with some good news. Value-oriented brands like B&amp;amp;M, Lidl, and ASDA all announced positive quarterly sales results last month, fashion retailers like H&amp;amp;M and Mango took advantage of low high street rents to open new stores, and overall retail sales value grew by 4.8% YoY, with volumes up 0.6% versus September. But sadly, that’s about as much festive cheer as I can scrape from the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>September retail sales volumes lowest in 18 months</title>
      <link>https://www.bjss.com/industry-insights/september-retail-sales-volumes-lowest-in-18-months</link>

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="margin-top: 25px;"&gt;In the build up to the crucial Christmas trading period, retailers are looking to break records, however, this month’s &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/bulletins/retailsales/september2022" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;ONS retail figures&lt;/a&gt; are not the records they were hoping for. September’s UK retail stats mark an 18-month low point; retail volumes fell by 6.9% YoY to their lowest level in over 18 months, driven by rising inflation, which has steadily risen from 0.7% to 10.1% over the same 18-month period. Gas prices, similarly, have risen consistently over the last 24 months, with resulting pressure on disposable income contributing to an 18-month decline in consumer confidence. This, coupled with unemployment, which in September stood at 3.6%, the second lowest rate since 1974, puts retailers into an untenable situation: rising costs and rising prices against a consumer base fatigued by sustained pressures on their cost of living and levels of optimism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
