          <span><p>For retailers, the value of data is clear to see. Yet <strong><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/85-of-big-data-projects-fail-but-your-developers-can-help-yours-succeed/">Gartner estimates that around 85% of big data</a></strong> projects fail.</p>
<p>BJSS, alongside Microsoft and the Co-op, explore the barriers that are preventing many retailers from becoming data-driven in the <strong><a href="../democratising-data/indexc6eb.html?hsLang=en">Democratising Data webinar on Wednesday 3rd&nbsp;February 2021 at 12:00-13:30 GMT</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralph-robinson-80a21632/?originalSubdomain=uk">Ralph Robinson</a></strong>, Head of Retail and Consumer Markets at BJSS, joins <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wadsworthrobert/?originalSubdomain=uk">Rob Wadsworth</a></strong>, Head of Data Engineering at Co-op and <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/watkinslouise/?originalSubdomain=uk">Louise Watkins</a></strong>, Head of Retail, Consumer Goods, Travel and Transport at Microsoft to share their learnings from working on some of the industry’s most innovative and ambitious data projects. By attending the event, you’ll gain first-hand insight into how you can rapidly embed data into your retail strategy in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span>Still not sure?</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting a data project off the ground is difficult. They take a lot of time. They require many skills. And if you get them wrong, you can be set back months or even years. In some cases, projects may be abandoned altogether. The result can be a somewhat disgruntled leadership team and a reduced investment in data. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>We all know the potential data has for the retail industry. Those who are getting it right are already reaping the benefits. From Amazon, which generates 35% of its sales from data-driven recommendations to ASOS and its use of advanced analytics for its Style and Match service which has helped the company become one of the leading retailers for online fashion advice. There are numerous stories where retailers have been utilising their data effectively to create real business value. And you too can create your own data success story.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span>Learning from the best</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p>So you’re probably in agreement that data is essential to retailers. And you most likely recognise the impacts of not getting it right. That’s why we have gathered some of the industry’s data thought leaders in a one-off exclusive webinar session – Democratising Data.</p>
<p>Rob Wadsworth is an experienced digital product leader with a passion for data, who leads the Co-op’s Data Engineering team across all aspects of the business. Rob and his team have built a cutting-edge data platform to underpin all the company’s future data initiatives. His work helps to radically change the way the Co-op approaches business intelligence and analytics, enabling a significant progression in the company’s use of machine learning and real-time decision support.</p>
<p>Joining Rob is Louise Watkins, the sector lead for Retail, Consumer Goods, Travel and Transport at Microsoft. Louise supports her teams and the executives within her industries to serve their colleagues and customers in a data-driven way. Louise’s work helps retailers generate value and growth through new customer experiences, digital innovation, and new business models and value expansion.</p>
<p>Completing the trio is Ralph Robinson, an experienced retail advisor. He has worked in-house for leading retail brands such as Tesco, Lidl and dunnhumby. Ralph has also consulted with a breadth of retail brands across retail technology, business strategy and customer analytics. In his current role as the Head of Retail and Consumer Markets at BJSS, Ralph has been facilitating business change amongst BJSS’ retail clients – advising on digital technology and delivery and data-centric change programmes.</p>
