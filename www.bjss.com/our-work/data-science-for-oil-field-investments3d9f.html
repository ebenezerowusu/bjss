          <span><h3><span><strong>A global oil and gas major needed to find a way to forecast the quality of its existing estate of oil fields, while also identifying the commercial prospects of new oil field investments.</strong></span>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>Our client’s existing process had previously been handled through Excel and VBA. This relied on many manual interventions and time investment from Subject Matter Experts to build forecasts.</strong></p>
<p>It created a very slow and user-heavy process to generate even a single forecast for a field. It was criticised for providing insufficient insight into the most important measurements to deriving quality of the field. And it was unsympathetic to small changes in those measurements too.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Modern Data Science techniques and a cloud-native architecture to provide rapid business value</strong></span>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>By using Python and a range of Dimensionality Reduction and Regression tools – such as Principal Component Analysis and Random Forests – we validated a new forecasting algorithm against known historic data.</p>
<p>This algorithm was demonstrably better than the existing process.</p>
<p>After the fundamental algorithm was validated and could flag anomalies, a Monte Carlo approach was applied to the sensitivities. We did this by sampling known distributions for the input parameters to allow insight into the impact on the quality score.</p>
<p><strong>In the time taken for an analyst to execute a single forecast, approximately 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations aggregated the most likely value and distribution of values.</strong></p>
<h3><span>Combining our wider experience in cloud, Enterprise Agile and software delivery</span>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We built a Cloud Native solution using Azure ML Studio to create the model and corresponding Web-services. A web application Front-end was developed for analysts, with a corresponding Back-end that can scale up and down dynamically.</p>
<p>Our solution reduced the execution time from several hours (including manual processes) for a single run, to under one minute to generate 1,000 runs. Crucially, it also provides a unified and versionable tool that ensures consistency across the company.</p>
<h3><span>We delivered efficiency savings of around 25 per cent, and have enabled greater insight and a better-informed decision-making process that benefits the whole business.</span>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>With the Cloud Native architecture of the application, the<span> business </span>has now developed the capability to substantially expand the number of oil fields it is considering for purchase or disposal. It has also improved reliability and has enabled a team of over 250 analysts to focus on the revenue-enhancing aspects of their roles.</p>
