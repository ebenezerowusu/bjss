&lt;strong&gt;As we fight this global crisis on multiple fronts throughout the world, no aspect of everyday life has remained untouched. The economic impacts of this pandemic are enormous, and we still have a long way to go in understanding the full set of risks we face, not least the epidemiological catastrophe that continues to shut down countries throughout the globe.&lt;/strong&gt;

      <title>The ‘new’ beauty trends</title>

 &lt;a href="https://www.bjss.com/covid-19/the-new-beauty-trends/" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.bjss.com/hubfs/BJSS_May2021/Images/ethan-brooke-b203hfveE-I-unsplash-scaled.jpg" alt="The ‘new’ beauty trends" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt that 2020 will be remembered. If there is something everyone can agree on, it is how the power of social media has been able to unite humanity this year across multiple issues; such as the protection of the environment, and equal rights. This growing social media usage has also enabled businesses to market and advertise like never before. However, their approach has had to shift to demonstrate their social and economic awareness during these challenging times. Trends previously showcased on TikTok and Instagram have evolved to be more sensitive and conscious in a post-COVID-19 world. For example, Huda Kattan has started to provide more tutorials on her YouTube channel instead of purely pushing expensive products. Beauty brands have also been held accountable and challenged in terms of their diversity and offering. In this article, we’ll look forward to the &lt;strong&gt;Renew &lt;/strong&gt;stage of recovery and discuss the ‘new’ trends which we have seen arise as a result of the last few months and whether they truly are ‘new’. We’ll also look at what beauty brands should be focusing on as they &lt;strong&gt;regroup&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;renew&lt;/strong&gt; their approach to the market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
