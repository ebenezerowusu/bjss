          <span><p><span>There's been a focus on carbon emissions at BJSS for some time now. We've been carbon neutral since 2019 and are committed to achieving Net Zero emissions by 2025. Recently, I've seen a lot of chatter about tools available to measure carbon emissions from the use of cloud services, both as a topic of interest (or marketing pushed by cloud vendors) but also as something we've used on projects to monitor and improve the emissions impact of cloud platforms.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>As a result, I've been thinking a lot lately about how it might be possible to build greener software. In this article, I’m going to share my thoughts on the topic – although bear in mind they are just thoughts, they’re not based on cold, hard implementation experience. For the purposes of this article, I'm just going to focus on the technical side of things. Of course, there are plenty of other aspects that feed into overall environmental impact – for example, designing a user interface to minimise energy use, applying software to make business processes more sustainable, or changing the ways we work to be more efficient. While those may have a large impact on reducing carbon emissions, I’m going to put them to one side.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I mentioned the availability of cloud emissions tools. These are a positive step, though they only paint some of the picture:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>They only measure the impact of cloud-based services (not front-end, onward network, or other hardware, for example). This is certainly a step forward, especially as it measures direct and indirect emissions, but the impact of reducing figures on the dashboard can be potentially misleading (e.g., switching from server-side to client-side rendering, potentially reducing overall energy efficiency).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>While they can support a business looking to reduce its overall environmental impact, they can also be more cynically used simply as a reporting or accountability tick-box.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>There is only so much information service-level granularity can give you about how to reduce the environmental impact of your software.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>While you can use these tools throughout development, the approach that they support is designed to be an operations optimisation – it’s an incremental improvement mechanism and the starting point is reliant on how the solution was designed and developed in the first place. To ensure we have a good starting point from which to improve, we need to look at things like requirements, architecture, and even the approach to development taken.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
