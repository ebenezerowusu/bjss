          <span><p>Growing up, I never found tinkering with gadgets interesting enough to explore. YouTube, and its plethora of everything about anything, wasn't a thing until I was finishing college, so technology felt very abstract. While I overheard talk of a robotics club in high school, I always considered things like that to be out of reach. Pursuing chemistry in college and grad school, I never even wrote a line of code (unless you count a Geocities website I made from HTML in the late 90s). In the last five years or so since I got into software development, my passion for all things technology sparked. I conquered my irrational fear of using Linux, set up various servers, hosted a website, networked my home, and so on. I've listened to talks about Internet of Things (IoT), learned how to do basic electrical work, and made my home a Smart Home.</p>

<p>Coming in with experience as a Java Web Developer, when I joined BJSS I had no idea what was in store for me. In my first week, I was on calls trying to figure out what sort of incubator projects I could work on, and one involving <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AWS IoT Core</a> was the front runner. The first couple weeks involved researching what services AWS had to offer someone building, using, and managing IoT devices. I had a RaspberryPi 3B+ lying around that was at one point set up to work a Retro Gaming System, but I had only used it once. So, with little to no prior AWS experience, I quickly installed the Raspberry Pi OS and the AWS IoT Python SDK and started learning hands-on about messaging, pub/sub, and AWS features.</p>
<p>As our small team started running out of ideas for what to research, and Smart Office solutions became the obvious direction, I remembered one of the things I noticed on my first day in the New York office: it was loud. An all-hands was scheduled that day, so the office was packed. I even overheard someone apologizing for the noise on their Zoom meeting. If only there was a way to help the office maintain a reasonable volume level. Hence, the idea for a Volume Excess Notification System was born.</p></span>
