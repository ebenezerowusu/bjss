          <span><h4>Background...</h4>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>One of our Business Consultants, Georgia Price, tells us how she got into Consulting, what she enjoys most about working at BJSS and provides her insights on the future of the industry.</p>
<p><strong>“I really enjoy the opportunities to get involved in different work outside of client projects…I’m helping the team with marketing, I’ve written articles and thought leadership, and I’m helping to grow our People and Change offer.</strong>”</p>
<p>My first role after University was as a Communication and Change Management Consultant, working on projects mainly in the HR space. I really enjoyed the people focus of the role but wanted to get more involved in broader organisational transformation projects, so joining the Consulting Team, with a focus on People and Change, was the perfect fit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Working at BJSS</h4>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>For me, there are two things: the people and the opportunities. I joined BJSS in the middle of the pandemic, so I onboarded completely virtually. However, everyone has been extremely welcoming, open, and collaborative, and really made me feel part of the team. I find it hard to believe now that I’ve never met most people in person. I also really enjoy the freedom you’re given to get involved in different work outside of client projects if you want to. I’m helping the team with marketing, I’ve written articles and thought leadership, and I’m helping to grow our People and Change offer.</p>
<p>My favourite project was working with a UK railway company to create an app to digitise a paper-based inspection process. It was a fast-paced project where we went from initial concept to a fully functioning app and rolling this out within the pilot station in just three months. I really enjoyed getting to spend time with the station team to understand what they needed and wanted from the app and then seeing their excitement when it came to life. Usually a change-resistant organisation, it made engaging them in the new process and way of working very easy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How does BJSS support the future of the industry?</h4>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>I think the pandemic will be an interesting turning point for the way many organisations deliver change. With the luxury of time removed, organisations have had to implement what would previously have been meticulously planned, multi-year digital transformation programmes in a way much more akin to agile. I’m hoping that organisations will continue to build on this momentum and deliver future changes at the same pace. At BJSS, we have our own Enterprise Agile methodology which is perfectly aligned to helping organisations to do this, and I am excited to continue to develop our agile change management approach, focusing on the impact on employees, to compliment this.</p>
