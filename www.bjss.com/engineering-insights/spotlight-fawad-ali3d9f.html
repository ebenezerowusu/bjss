          <span><h4>Background...</h4>
<p>Software Engineer, Fawad, talks about being inspired by video games, working on projects that make a difference during Covid, and the importance of pushing yourself out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p>I was, and still am, really into console gaming - what I originally wanted to do was develop games for a living. I studied software engineering at university, but then I realised that video game development is difficult and doesn’t pay that well! So, after I graduated, I worked on a series of software development roles for Ford, BBC, and Sky. But I was starting to get a bit too comfortable. I felt like I needed a change, to be pushed out of my comfort zone. I saw an opportunity at BJSS, applied, and not long after that I joined as a Software Engineer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Working at BJSS</h4>
<p>As a Software Engineer at BJSS, I focus on projects that require front-end work, working mainly with Javascript and technologies like React. A lot of the time, I’m just cracking on with coding – getting the requirements from the client and plugging away at them. I like solving puzzles, and software engineering is kind of like a puzzle. When you’re coding, you’ve got a problem and you have to find a way to solve it. I really enjoy that aspect of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Reducing Emergency Department Overcrowding and Waiting Times</h4>
<p>The most memorable project I worked on recently was&nbsp;the Emergency Department Digital Integration (EDDI) system. EDDI gives NHS 111 staff an interface into emergency departments and lets them give patients a specific ED arrival time based on their need.</p>
<p>I worked&nbsp;on the front-end, writing code&nbsp;for the interface that EDDI&nbsp;end-users&nbsp;access. A lot of what I contributed was around&nbsp;login and authentication, as well as admin features like being able to add new A&amp;E departments&nbsp;to the system and generating reports on capacity numbers.</p>
<p>It was a challenging project because the deadlines were&nbsp;very tight. We&nbsp;didn’t have long to get the system up and running,&nbsp;so we&nbsp;had to get stuck in.&nbsp;But the team at BJSS did an amazing job planning the whole project, and we managed to get something working and delivering results quickly.</p>
<p>It felt good to&nbsp;be&nbsp;doing something that was&nbsp;helping people, especially&nbsp;at a time&nbsp;during the pandemic&nbsp;when the NHS was massively stretched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What do you like about BJSS?</h4>
<p>For years,&nbsp;I was having to change jobs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;pushed&nbsp;out of my comfort zone.&nbsp;But, at BJSS, when a project finishes,&nbsp;I move onto something new, working with totally different technologies,&nbsp;sometimes in an industry I haven’t worked on before.&nbsp;And when&nbsp;I’ve&nbsp;had&nbsp;to&nbsp;pick things up from scratch, there’s always been support readily available. My line manager has been&nbsp;really helpful&nbsp;on that front,&nbsp;pointing me towards resources to help me learn.</p>
<p>There are plenty of opportunities to develop at BJSS. For example, I was made a Tech Lead on a recent project, so I oversaw 10 or 12 developers and testers, putting all the ways of working in place and being responsible for quality. Having done it now, I think I’d prefer to focus on code, but it was the first time I’d ever done something like that. It pushed me to grow as a person, which was great.</p>
<p>Having&nbsp;worked for big organisations in the past, you often feel like you get lost, like you’re just a cog in a machine. BJSS&nbsp;is&nbsp;really good&nbsp;at recognising you for the work you deliver.&nbsp;You feel valued,&nbsp;like you’ve made a meaningful contribution to your projects and&nbsp;to&nbsp;BJSS as a whole.</p></span>
