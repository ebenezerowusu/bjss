        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
          <span><p><span>Online shopping&nbsp;surged&nbsp;following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic&nbsp;and<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-ecommerce-forecast-2021%0D" rel="noopener" target="_blank">retail e-commerce sales are predicted to grow by 16.8% in 2021 to $4.921 trillion.</a><span>&nbsp;However, a small handful of companies will eat up a large chunk of this&nbsp;because&nbsp;the US e-commerce sector is dominated by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/579718/most-popular-us-shopping-apps-ranked-by-audience/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>retailers like Amazon and Walmart</span></a><span>, with 150 million users (46% of the US population) and 86 million users (26%), respectively.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Early-adopter advantage, pre-existing scale and strategic use of technology have made these companies difficult for smaller retailers to compete&nbsp;with,&nbsp;while also setting a high standard for the e-commerce experience all retailers must offer.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So&nbsp;what are you supposed to do to&nbsp;compete with the e-commerce giants? Luckily, there are quick, effective ways that you can offer the same online experiences that the big players do at a fraction of the cost. In this article, we’ll explore how emerging technologies around personalization, price optimization, social content aggregation, delivery optimization and&nbsp;scalable conversational commerce&nbsp;could give you a competitive edge.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<h2>1. Anonymous Personalization</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span>The value of customer data to drive sales is clear –&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2015/06/25/amazon-prime-members-convert-74-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amazon’s conversion rate for Prime members</a><span>&nbsp;(the customers it holds the&nbsp;most comprehensive data on) is a staggering 74%. Yet up to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.dynamicyield.com/lesson/anonymous-visitor-tracking/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">97% of website visitors remain anonymous</a><span>&nbsp;and legislation like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is setting a precedent for how states can enact strong privacy controls online. Are&nbsp;brick-and-mortar&nbsp;retailers&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;helpless to personalize the&nbsp;online shopping&nbsp;experience?&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Apparently no longer! Zero-cookie anonymous website personalization&nbsp;platforms now exist, allowing retailers to segment visitors and personalize their experiences in real-time. This expands the target market from just those customers who are signed in or using loyalty schemes to the majority of visitors. With some big-name integrations like Shopify, Salesforce and WordPress, and customers from Boohoo to Speedo, there might just be something in it. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Check out</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://personifyxp.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Personify XP</a><span> is&nbsp;a good place to start&nbsp;(although there are alternatives).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>2. Price optimization</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Did you know that,&nbsp;in 2020,&nbsp;on average&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">88% of online shopping orders were abandoned&nbsp;worldwide</a><span>?&nbsp;And if you’re unable to compete with the low prices of Amazon, with its huge economies of scale, you might have to look for more creative ways to reverse those&nbsp;missed sales opportunities. One option is&nbsp;to&nbsp;let customers negotiate on price. Bartering has&nbsp;worked in physical retail for centuries, but&nbsp;until now it’s been&nbsp;much more challenging online. Enter solutions like&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.nibbletechnology.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nibble</a><span>,&nbsp;where&nbsp;simple&nbsp;blue price buttons&nbsp;integrate into your&nbsp;product listings and allow&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;to&nbsp;haggle&nbsp;over the price&nbsp;with a chatbot.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried this for myself and it’s&nbsp;really&nbsp;fun!&nbsp;Don’t expect rock bottom discounts,&nbsp;however,&nbsp;since&nbsp;retailers&nbsp;set upper and lower thresholds,&nbsp;but&nbsp;a small saving on a product combined with&nbsp;the interactive&nbsp;experience of&nbsp;bartering&nbsp;could&nbsp;improve conversion. According to Nibble,&nbsp;most customers still buy full price even&nbsp;with a&nbsp;haggle option, but it seems a great&nbsp;way&nbsp;to maximise the chance of closing deals for shoppers who love a bargain.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>3. Social content aggregation</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Nearly three-quarters (74%)&nbsp;of North American&nbsp;consumers spend&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/study/12393/social-networks-statista-dossier/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>an average of&nbsp;1.6 hours a day&nbsp;on social media</span></a><span>,&nbsp;so&nbsp;it’s not surprising that retailers are increasing their activity and analysis of these lucrative sales platforms.&nbsp;Nevertheless, it’s difficult&nbsp;(if not impossible)&nbsp;to sift through&nbsp;all the&nbsp;content relevant to your brand and integrate the&nbsp;right messaging into your e-commerce experience.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However,&nbsp;solutions like&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.knexus.co/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Knexus</a><span> use&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence&nbsp;and other technologies&nbsp;to&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;analyze&nbsp;your social content and seamlessly&nbsp;integrate&nbsp;it into your shoppers’ online journey.&nbsp;Regardless of location,&nbsp;content&nbsp;can be&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;tagged and indexed before integrating&nbsp;rich, engaging&nbsp;material&nbsp;back into your own e-commerce site. This data can also improve personalization&nbsp;and&nbsp;conversion by removing the&nbsp;need&nbsp;for shoppers to leave the site for social validation or to seek out off-site reviews. With some impressive conversion uplift stats, it’s one to consider if social proof plays an important role in your shopper journey.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>4. Delivery optimization</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span>The number of parcels being delivered went through the roof over the pandemic and </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1011025/delivery-robot-market-size-worldwide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">delivery robot volumes are forecast to quadruple in the next five years to become a $579m industry</a><span>.&nbsp;However, we’re still years away from competitively priced autonomous delivery for retailers aside from big&nbsp;players&nbsp;like Amazon, which means that&nbsp;getting delivery right is critical in the meantime.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Delivering items to the right&nbsp;location is still a pain point for many customers - ZIP&nbsp;codes are notoriously inaccurate and a source of frustration for delivery drivers and satnav users alike!&nbsp;Solutions like&nbsp;</span><a href="https://what3words.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>what3words</span></a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.posttag.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PostTag</a><span>, however,&nbsp;provide&nbsp;more accurate locations. The latter is used&nbsp;by delivery brands and retailers&nbsp;to provide precise&nbsp;consumer and business&nbsp;locations to their drivers, increasing efficiency and reducing wasted time searching for the right door or entrance.&nbsp;More efficient delivery&nbsp;also significantly&nbsp;reduces&nbsp;carbon emissions, providing both a social and economic reason for businesses to reconsider their routing and delivery optimization.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Check out</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.posttag.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PostTag</a><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><a href="https://what3words.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what3words<span>. </span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>3. Scalable conversational commerce</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span>When&nbsp;everyone wants&nbsp;customers&nbsp;to&nbsp;download their&nbsp;app,&nbsp;why not&nbsp;just&nbsp;meet customers where they already are?&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/two-billion-users-connecting-the-world-privately" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Two billion people used WhatsApp in 2020</a><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and retailers are fast&nbsp;realising&nbsp;the power of&nbsp;the&nbsp;platform for shopper engagement and communication.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Solutions like&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hellodone.ai/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HelloDone</a><span>&nbsp;provide&nbsp;conversational AI at scale, facilitating customer order tracking, product queries and returns,&nbsp;all through a familiar existing platform like WhatsApp or Facebook&nbsp;Messenger. This clever solution harnesses automation&nbsp;to&nbsp;make it easier&nbsp;for retailers&nbsp;to&nbsp;instantly&nbsp;answer customer&nbsp;questions,&nbsp;improve&nbsp;retention and reduce&nbsp;frustration. Shoppers can use the solution to&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;navigate to relevant information&nbsp;without needing to learn how to use a new website,&nbsp;fill out a&nbsp;form or&nbsp;download an&nbsp;app.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
